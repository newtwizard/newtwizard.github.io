The world does not want to kill you. She made monsters to scare you from her wonders. They keep you in the village, and out of the woods. The monsters know a hundred colorful ways to scare you. Death is only the last one.

I’ve been thinking lately about what monsters want. About what a monster is willing to do to get what it wants, and how high killing you is on that list, if you get in their way.

I often put killing pretty low on the list, sometimes without even meaning to. I used to think this was a mistake, and tried to steer my instincts in away from that. I didn’t want to completely blur the line between a monster and another character. They needed to have a certain purpose. 

But I’ve learned a monster doesn’t need to kill you to remain a monster. It just needs to threaten something you care about.

Even if a monster doesn’t want to kill you (yet), it can still be a threat to…

- Your stuff
- Your time
- Your comfort (You can think of this one as “changing the character’s life in some way they probably will find annoying at best, and horrifying at worst”. My favorite of the three.)

You’ll find the results in the table below threatens one of these three things. Multiply that by thirty-three. Here are a hundred ways a monster can hurt you:

1. Eat all your food.
2. Bury you, except for your head.
3. Curse your gold. No merchant will trust you again if they catch you.
4. Replace one of your eyes with their own.
5. Explode in a shower of soot. It’ll take days to clean everything.
6. Rip your bags to shreds.
7. Give you an embarrassing nickname that sticks.
8. Pee on all your stuff.
9. Scream loudly. Something will surely hear.
10. Poison your blood. You’ll begin convulsing soon.
11. Spread a nasty rumor about you. 
12. Infect you with a disease.
13. Give you bad luck for seven years, as if you’ve broken a mirror. All your critical successes turn to failures.
14. Make you lose your way.

24. Turn your bones to jelly.
25. Make you stop feeling love.
26. Make you stop feeling loved.

Answering “how” the monster does these things can help the threat click into place.

This table is most definitely skewed monsters that are feyish, intelligent, and tricksy. It’s tricky to telegraph these threats clearly if the monster can’t speak. 

For more naturalistic monsters, thinking about what bits and bobs might allow them to accomplish these threats can be very fun, if a bit of a stretch at times.
