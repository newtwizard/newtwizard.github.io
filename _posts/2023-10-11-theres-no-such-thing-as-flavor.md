Lately, I’ve been trying to put into words what resonates with me about OSR-style play. Not really for any particular reason, but more to appease my compulsion to describe what I already know. After much pondering, I think I'm happy with this phrase to sum up my thoughts: 

**There is no such thing as flavor.**

Everything can be held, smelled, and tasted. It exists to be investigated, and destroyed, and changed. It matters that it exists – even when nobody knows why yet.

In the real world, we don’t call your broken ankle or a see-saw flavor. These things define our experience. These things matter. People often talk about flavor like it is something that sits outside "the rules". But flavor was there before the rules. 

**Flavor is everything.**

And we don't need rules to tell us how flavor works. We know when you fall feet first from a tree, you’ll break your ankle. We know when you sit on a see-saw, the other end goes up. We know the flavor of life – we’ve been tasting it our entire lives.

Rules are helpful because they can describe the world consistently when we cannot do so ourselves. If the rules no longer describe the world in a way that feels true to us, they have failed, and should be discarded or replaced, else the game lose its flavor entirely. If the game falls apart without those rules, then the flavor needs more salt.

Treat the other world like it’s real, and let your messy assumptions be your guide. Trust that compass inside you; the one you were born with; the one you’ve been honing your entire life. Your imagination suits you, and its the most powerful tool in the world. 

Rules are a tiny island in an endless ocean. Sooner or later, you’ll need to hop in your boat and sail out there with your friends. Don’t worry, that’s where all the fun is, anyways.
